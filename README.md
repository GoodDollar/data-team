# GoodDollar / data-team

Purpose This repo stores the queries, scripts, automation definitions, subgraph schemas and documentation used by the GoodDollar analytics & data team. It is the canonical place to:
  - store copy‑paste‑ready queries (Dune / SQL)
  - keep scheduled scripts and helper code (Google Apps Script, Node, etc.)
  - save automation JSONs (n8n flows)
  - document datasources, dashboards and data dictionaries
  - receive and triage work requests via GitHub Issues / PRs
